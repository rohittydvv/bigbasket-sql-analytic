# BigBasket Quick Commerce Data Analytics Using SQL

## Description

End-to-end SQL analytics project using BigBasket quick commerce transactional data. This repository demonstrates advanced SQL skills across data engineering, modeling, cleansing, analysis, and insight generation.

## Data Architecture Diagram

**Bronze Layer:** Raw CSV data ingestion, all fields as-is for traceability.  
**Silver Layer:** Cleansed, standardized tables with derived columns and validated business logic.  
**Gold Layer:** Star schema views and aggregated tables for high-performance analytical querying.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world BigBasket quick-commerce data using SQL Server, building a retail-grade data warehouse and uncovering actionable business insights through structured, maintainable SQL workflows.

### Goals

- Create a robust star schema warehouse for quick commerce analytics
- Transform, validate, and enrich raw operational data for accuracy and usability
- Build modular SQL queries and views for exploratory and advanced analytics
- Extract meaningful KPIs for business decision support

## Project Highlights

- Retail-optimized star schema with fact and dimension modeling  
- Automated cleansing and enrichment pipeline using stored procedures  
- Modular, reusable SQL transformations designed for scalability  
- Robust data quality checks (nulls, duplicates, relationship integrity)  
- In-depth exploratory and advanced analysis modules

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Key Findings

- Analyzed monthly trends in customer registrations, order volume, and total revenue
- Evaluated Average Order Value (AOV) patterns to understand customer spending behavior
- Studied the relationship between marketing spend and revenue over time
- Performed RFM and tenure-based segmentation to profile different customer groups
- Identified top customers and top products based on revenue and frequency metrics
- Assessed delivery efficiency and service quality using delay metrics and customer ratings
- Conducted cohort and cumulative analysis to understand retention and long-term growth patterns

---

## Advanced Analysis – Key Insights

- Measured MoM and YoY revenue growth to evaluate short- and long-term business momentum
- Identified peak ordering periods by hour and weekday for demand timing analysis
- Compared weekday vs weekend purchasing behavior for operational planning
- Isolated high-demand, high-margin products to support profitability strategies
- Analyzed channel and campaign performance to evaluate marketing effectiveness and ROI
- Investigated the impact of delivery delays on customer sentiment and ratings
- Calculated and compared Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) across tenure segments and payment methods

---

## Important Notes / Warnings

- All scripts tested using SQL Server Express; syntax may require adaptation for other platforms
- Always run ingestion, cleaning, and transformation scripts in **bronze → silver → gold** order
- Validate data using `silver_tests.sql` and `eda_queries/tests.sql` before analysis
- Adhere to organizational data privacy and handling requirements
